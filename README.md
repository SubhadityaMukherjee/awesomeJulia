# Julia Resources

> Note that most of these will be for deep learning/ Machine learning :)

- It took me 4 days to learn Julia to a working level. (Yes I have been coding for a while so it was way easier than I thought it would be)
- I am absolutely in love with the syntax
- Love the way you can write \gamma+\delta-y^\hat to get γ+δ+ŷ
