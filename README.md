# Julia Resources

- It took me 4 days to learn Julia to a working level. (Yes I have been coding for a while so it was way easier than I thought it would be)
- I am absolutely in love with the syntax
- Love the way you can write \gamma+\delta-y\hat to get γ+δ+ŷ

## Deep
- Want to learn DL??
- Have no idea where to start?
- Here is a personal compilation of links that have helped me get where I am today :)
- [Important links](https://gist.github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/6a70d6dc74783e2addac8bed475ac220)

### Neural Ode
- Something special and a work in progress. Using Ordinary differential equations to streamline networks
- [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366)

### StreamlineAPI (Contribute if you can :))
- Something fun I am working on. I do like the FluxML API but I wanted to make it better and more generalized

## Tips
- Yes it is a very new language so it will be hard to find Tutorials
- Use it if you want to do scientific computing and other languages are too slow
- I love the syntax even more than I did python's
- Do not shift to this as your primary language yet (Maybe in a few years)
- Do look at the repositories of the packages you are using. Julia is extremely easy to understand and you will be better off looking at existing codebases
- Some things dont exist yet so feel free to use python/R wrappers to get them done
- You can get stuff directly from cran/pypi
- Use R/python libraries to get datasets
- Contribute heavily!!!!


## Contribute
- Can I add to this list?? YES
- Please feel free to contribute to this repo by sending a PR.
- Anything that you wish to add which personally helped you is welcome :)
- If its your own package, please do add a note on usabilty if you are dropping a PR
